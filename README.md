A Ruby-On-Rails website made to boost a client's exposure online.

Using figma to create a mockup I then proceded to code the entire site in HTML/CSS and Javascript, using Ruby and Active Record's database functionality when necessary.

While creating this project I honed in on sound design principles and made responsiveness a key feature of the website.

This was my introduction to making stylish and visually-appealing freelance projects.
